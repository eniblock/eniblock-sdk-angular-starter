# Getting Started: Eniblock SDK with Angular

This project was created with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

First, ensure that you have the Angular CLI installed.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Next, install the necessary dependencies from the root directory of your project.

```bash
npm install
```

After this, configure the Eniblock class with your `appId`. This ID can be obtained from the [Eniblock SDK Admin Portal](https://sdk.eniblock.com/admin).

## Development Server

To start a development server, run `ng serve`. Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you modify any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

To generate a new component, use the command `ng generate component component-name`. You can also use `ng generate` with other directives such as `pipe`, `service`, `class`, `guard`, `interface`, `enum`, and `module`.

## Build

Use the `ng build` command to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests, execute `ng test` through [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

For executing end-to-end tests, use `ng e2e`. Choose a platform that implements end-to-end testing capabilities to use this command.

## Further Help

For more assistance with the Angular CLI, run `ng help` or visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
