# Getting Started: Eniblock SDK with Angular

This project was created with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

First, ensure that you have the Angular CLI installed.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Next, install the necessary dependencies from the root directory of your project.

```bash
npm install
```

After this, configure the Eniblock class with your `appId`. You can locate this in the `src/app/components/home/home.component.ts` file. This ID can be obtained from the [Eniblock SDK Admin Console](https://sdk.eniblock.com/admin).

## Development Server

To start a development server, run `ng serve`. Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you modify any of the source files.

## Integration of the SDK into an Angular Application
